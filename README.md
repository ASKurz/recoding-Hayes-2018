# recoding *Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis*

Andrew Hayes’s *Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis*  text, [the second edition of which just came out](http://afhayes.com/introduction-to-mediation-moderation-and-conditional-process-analysis.html), has become a staple in social science graduate education. Both editions of his text have been from a frequentist OLS perspective. This project is an effort to connect his work with the Bayesian paradigm. Herein I refit his models with my favorite R package for Bayesian regression, Bürkner’s [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms). I also prefer plotting with Wickham's [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), and recently converted to using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)-style syntax (which you might learn about [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) or [here](http://style.tidyverse.org)).

This repository contains the code and text behind the [recoding *Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis*](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/1523/access)
project. 

The project was stitched together using Yihui Xie's [bookdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
