Title: Conditional Process Modeling

Data:
    File is teams.txt;

Variable:
    Names are dysfunc negtone negexp perform;
    Usevariables are dysfunc negtone negexp perform mv;

Define:
    mv = negtone*negexp;
       
Analysis:
    Estimator = ML;
    Bootstrap = 10000;

Model: 
    !dysfunc(x) negtone(m) negexp(v) perform(y)
    negtone on dysfunc(a);
    perform on dysfunc(cprime); 
    perform on negtone(b1);
    perform on negexp(b2);
    perform on mv(b3);


Model Constraint:
    New (ind1 );!ind2 ind3 diff1 diff2 diff3);
    ind1 = a*(b1 + (b3*-0.73));
    !ind2 = a*b2;
    !ind3 = a*b3;
    !diff1 = ind1-ind2;
    !diff2 = ind1-ind3;
    !diff3 = ind2-ind3;

Output:
    tech1 tech4 stdy CINTERVAL(bcboot);

Plot:
