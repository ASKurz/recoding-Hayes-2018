Data:
    File is pmi.txt;

Variable:
    Names are cond pmi import reaction gender age;
    Usevariables are cond reaction pmi import;
   
Analysis:
    Estimator = Bayes ;
    Biterations = 170000(150000);
    processors = 2;
    point = mean;

Model: 
    import on cond (a1);
    pmi on cond (a2);
    reaction on cond import;
    reaction on import (b1);
    reaction on pmi (b2);

    pmi on import(d21);

Model Constraint:
    New(indimpor indpmi indpi diff1 diff2 diff3);
    indimpor = a1*b1;
    indpmi = a2*b2;
    indpi = a1*d21*b2;
    
    diff1 = indimpor-indpmi;
    diff2 = indimpor-indpi;
    diff3 = indpmi-indpi;
