Andrew Hayes's *Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis*  text, [the second edition of which just came out](http://afhayes.com/introduction-to-mediation-moderation-and-conditional-process-analysis.html), has become a staple in social science graduate education. Both editions of his text have been from a frequentist OLS perspective. This project is an effort to connect his work with the Bayesian paradigm. Herein I refit his models with my favorite **R** package for Bayesian regression, Bürkner’s [**brms**](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) use the packages from the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) to visualization and data manipulation. 

This repository contains the code and text behind the [Recoding *Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis*](https://bookdown.org/content/b472c7b3-ede5-40f0-9677-75c3704c7e5c/) book. It was all stitched together using Yihui Xie's [**bookdown** package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Enjoy.
