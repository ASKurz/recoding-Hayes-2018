This repository is the GitHub home for my **brms**/**tidyverse** translation of the second edition of Hayes's [*Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach*](https://www.guilford.com/books/Introduction-to-Mediation-Moderation-and-Conditional-Process-Analysis/Andrew-Hayes/9781462534654). You can find the current HTML version of my translation at [https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/recoding_Hayes_2018/](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/recoding_Hayes_2018/).

This project is something of a living document and I welcome corrections, suggestions, and solutions to any of the problems I have yet to fully work out. 

## Code of conduct

I don't care if you come off as professional or not, but please try to be kind.

## *I just have a question*.

I do not have a high enough question volume to need a formal question policy, at this time. I prefer it when people ask questions in an open format, such as in a [GitHub issue]( https://github.com/ASKurz/recoding-Hayes-2018/issues), as a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz) post, or on the [Stan Forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/c/interfaces/brms/36). That way others can (a) chime in and (b) benefit from the discussion. Other approaches, such as in personal emails, are fine. However, I reserve the right to respond at my own pace.

## *I would like to contribute*.

Great! I'm guessing most contributions will fall under:

* reporting typos, code breaks, and hyperlink breaks;
* reporting errors in the code;
* responding to requests for help either in the GitHub issues section or in the ebook itself (e.g., the end of [Section 7.1](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/recoding_Hayes_2018/fundamentals-of-moderation-analysis.html#conditional-and-unconditional-effects)); or
* requesting features.

I generally prefer people use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ASKurz/recoding-Hayes-2018/issues) for these. However, it's okay if you would like to make a pull request. Beware that PR's tend to make me nervous and I'm more likely to avoid them in favor of responding to the issues. Sometimes it makes sense to correspond with me by email, but I ask you use that as a last option.

## Code style

I generally follow the recommendations in [*The tidyverse style guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/), but I have a few quirky conventions of my own. If you plan on recommending a big chunk of code, **tidyverse** conventions are generally preferred.

## Credit

In my recent books, I have made it a practice to thank my contributors in the `index.Rmd` file. This project has been simple enough that I havenâ€™t had reason to adopt that practice, yet. However, should your contribution make its way into the book, I will ll happily add your name and GitHub handle to a thank-you list. If for some reason you don't want to be added to the list, please let me know and I'll respect your privacy.
